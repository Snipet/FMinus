// src/runtime/Runtime.h: the FMinus runtime, the C functions generated code calls. It builds as its own static
// library, libfminus_runtime.a (FMinus::Runtime), with no LLVM in it. A process that JITs links it and hands each
// function to LLJIT by address (support/JitRuntime.h); an executable from fminus::aot links the library itself, so
// JIT'd and ahead-of-time code call the same functions. Every function here is listed in RuntimeSymbols.def.
//
// An integration piece that came with the project skeleton: the ABI version below is a placeholder for the real
// runtime. Keep at least one source in runtime/ (the library cannot be empty).
